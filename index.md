# 👋 Welcome to My Google Apps Script Portfolio

I'm **Josh Watjen** – a teacher, tinkerer, and aspiring administrator. This page showcases the Google Apps Script tools I've developed to make school operations smoother, more efficient, and a whole lot less stressful for teachers and staff.

These projects were created during my time in the classroom and as part of my principal internship. Every line of code solves a real problem I've encountered in a school setting.
