# Google Apps Script Projects

This repository contains a collection of Google Apps Script projects I've developed as part of my professional work as an educator and administrator-in-training.

Each project is designed to streamline school operations, improve staff engagement, and support equitable student services through automation and efficiency.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. AutoFill Google Docs
Pretty self-explanatory here...fill in the information on a Google sheet (the URL to an example sheet can be found in Code.js) and it will transfer to a Google Doc Template like magic! Be sure you edit Lines 18 and 21 to reflect the URL of your Doc Template (Line 18) and your Google Drive Folder (Line 21). Additionally, the rest of the code should be changed to reflect your needs.

### 2. Chromebook Collection
This Apps Script is what I use when collecting every student Chromebook on the last day of school to ensure an accurate collection. The Sheet template's URL can be found in the Code.js file. 

### 3. Increase/Decrease Font Size
Have you ever wanted to adjust the font size of and entire Google Doc but don't want to spend the time highlighting each individual section? Well then this script is for you! Simply add this Script to your Google Doc and then authorize the script. Highlight the entire section you want to adjust and then use the UI to make the necessary adjustments!

### 4. Scholastic Squire Docs Creator
This is the same idea as the AutoFill Google Docs file, except it has been tailored to a specific need at my school. This could be used for quickly making student awards, etc.

### 5. Squire Shout Out
This script allows for a user to enter some information into a Google Form, then, once it is transfered to a Google Sheet, it sends out an email automatically to the address entered by the user. One thing to note: this must be set up to be emailed from ONE Google Account. I am sure someone who is smarter than me can figure out how to send it from another location.

### 6. Team Schedule
This script automatically sorts information. In this case, it allowed me to see the individual practice schedules for all of the basketball teams at school. As a busy athletic director, this came in very handy for organizational purposes. 

### 7. Timed Google Form (incomplete)
While this one is somewhat incomplete, the idea is there. Eventually, I bailed from the Google Sheets version and moved to a self-hosted project elsehwere. However, the nuts and bolts are there for a teacher to create a timed Google Forms exam/test.
