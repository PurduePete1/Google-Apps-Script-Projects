This repository contains a collection of Google Apps Script projects I've developed as part of my professional work as an educator and administrator-in-training.

Each project is designed to streamline school operations, improve staff engagement, and support equitable student services through automation and efficiency.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. [AutoFill Google Docs](./AutoFill%20Google%20Docs)

Pretty self-explanatory—fill in the information on a Google Sheet (the URL to an example sheet can be found in `Code.js`) and it will transfer to a Google Doc template like magic.  
> ✏️ Be sure to edit **Lines 18 and 21** to reflect your actual Doc Template URL and the destination Google Drive folder. You’ll also want to tweak the rest of the code to match your needs.

### 2. 🗳️ [Candidate Scoring Tool](./CandidateScoring)
Scores and ranks speaker or award candidates based on ranked-choice form submissions. Ideal for committees, guest speaker selection, and more.

---

### 3. [Chromebook Collection](./Chromebook%20Collection)

This Apps Script helps with the mass collection of student Chromebooks at the end of the school year. The associated Google Sheet template URL can be found in the `Code.js` file.

---

### 4. [Increase/Decrease Font Size](./Increase-Decrease%20Font%20Size)

Ever wanted to adjust the font size of *an entire Google Doc* without tediously highlighting each section? Add this script to your Google Doc, authorize it, then highlight any section and use the custom UI to adjust the size. It’s that simple.

---

### 5. [Scholastic Squire Docs Creator](./Scholastic%20Squire%20Docs%20Creator)

A specialized version of the AutoFill project tailored to our school’s needs—great for generating student awards or other templated documents in bulk.

---

### 6. [Squire Shout Out](./Squire%20Shout%20Out)

This script allows a user to fill out a Google Form, and when the response lands in a Sheet, it automatically sends an email to the recipient.  
> 📧 Heads up: This must be set up and run from a single Google account (due to authorization limitations). Someone smarter than me (read: future me) might figure out how to make it multi-account friendly.

---

### 7. [Team Schedule](./Team%20Schedule)

Automatically sorts team data into individualized schedules. Originally built to manage practice schedules for all basketball teams—made my life as an athletic director a whole lot easier.

---

### 8. [Timed Google Form (Incomplete)](./Timed%20Google%20Form)

A partially completed idea for creating timed Google Forms. I later transitioned this to a self-hosted project, but the foundational logic is here for any teacher wanting to experiment with timed assessments.
